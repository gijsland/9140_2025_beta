/**
 * A SysId characterization routine for a single mechanism. Mechanisms may have multiple motors.
 *
 * <p>A single subsystem may have multiple mechanisms, but mechanisms should not share test
 * routines. Each complete test of a mechanism should have its own SysIdRoutine instance, since the
 * log name of the recorded data is determined by the mechanism name.
 *
 * <p>The test state (e.g. "quasistatic-forward") is logged once per iteration during test
 * execution, and once with state "none" when a test ends. Motor frames are logged every iteration
 * during test execution.
 *
 * <p>Timestamps are not coordinated across data, so motor frames and test state tags may be
 * recorded on different log frames. Because frame alignment is not guaranteed, SysId parses the log
 * by using the test state flag to determine the timestamp range for each section of the test, and
 * then extracts the motor frames within the valid timestamp ranges. If a given test was run
 * multiple times in a single logfile, the user will need to select which of the tests to use for
 * the fit in the analysis tool.
